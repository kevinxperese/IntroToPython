What does this mean? Let's say that the directory with your Python executable file is \"yourname/Documents/.\" When you download Python, this path is *usually* added to your PATH. So, when you open the command line, you can type \"python\" and your system will no to look for a file named \"python.exe\" in one of the directories in your PATH (including yourname/Documents) and try to execute it.\n",

Documentation gives you the syntax of the various functions associated with a package, best practices, and examples. It's usually a good idea to read these for any packages you use.
